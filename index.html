 <p> Ah San Francisco, what a beaut you are. Sometimes your spontaneous 10 minute thunderstorms and midday fog drives the locals crazy, <br> but that never stops the tourists from coming into town. Below I've compiled some of the few places the locals never stop <br> visiting despite the construction pits and impossible parking. </p>

<h2> Hidden Gems of San Francisco </h2>
	<ol> 
		<b><li>Golden Gate Park</li></b>
		<p>Somehow people always focus on the bridge and forgets about the park. Every Sunday they have free swing dance lessons and our best museums are located here!</p>
		<b> <li>Chinatown</li></b>
		<p> Be sure to check out Stockton Street, not Grant Street! That's where all the tourist traps are! </p>
		<b> <li>Urban Putt</li></b>
		<p> Hands down, coolest indoor mini golf place ever!</p>
		<b> <li>Musée Mécanique</li></b>
		<p> My favorite (and cheapest) place of all time. You could easily spend 3 hours here without realizing it.  </p>
		<b> <li>Mission Dolores</li></b>
		<p> Take a break here at Mission Dolores and enjoy the SF view! </p>
		<b> <li>Moraga Stairs</li></b>
		<p>Instagram worthy stairs made into mosaic art!</p>
