<p> Ah San Francisco, what a beaut you are. Sometimes your spontaneous 10 minute thunderstorms and midday fog drives the locals crazy, but that never stops the tourists from coming into town. Below I've compiled some of the few places the locals never stop visiting despite the construction pits and impossible parking. </p>


<h2> Top Tourist Attractions </h2>
	<ol> 
		<b><li>Painted Ladies</li></b>
		<p>Come here for Full House pictures! </p>
		<b> <li>Fisherman's Wharf</li></b>
		<p> Check out all the sleeping sea lions! </p>
		<b> <li>Lombard Street (Crooked Street)</li></b>
		<p> Drive down the most crooked street in the world! </p>
		<b> <li>Golden Gate Bridge</li></b>
		<p> Best Red Bridge in the universe! </p>
		<b> <li>Palace of Fine Arts </li></b>
		<p> Pillars of greatness located here! </p>
		<b> <li>Union Square</li></b>
		<p> Take a picture with the iconic heart sculptures!</p>
	</ol>
<p> Other than the typical tourist attractions, as an SF native here are a few hidden gems I recommend going whenever you're in the city! </p> 

<h2> Hidden Gems of San Francisco </h2>
	<ol> 
		<b><li>Golden Gate Park</li></b>
		<p>Somehow people always focus on the bridge and forgets about the park. Every Sunday they have free swing dance lessons and our best museums are located here!</p>
		<b> <li>Chinatown</li></b>
		<p> Be sure to check out Stockton Street, not Grant Street! That's where all the tourist traps are! </p>
		<b> <li>Urban Putt</li></b>
		<p> Hands down, coolest indoor mini golf place ever!</p>
		<b> <li>Musée Mécanique</li></b>
		<p> My favorite (and cheapest) place of all time. You could easily spend 3 hours here without realizing it.  </p>
